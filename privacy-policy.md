# Privacy Policy

Effective date: October 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Haukaas AS (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the FOODMap scanner mobile application (“App”). By using the App, you agree to this Policy.

## What we do in the App
- Scan barcodes to fetch public product data from Open Food Facts.
- Optionally analyze photos of food or labels for potential FODMAP risk using an AI service.
- Sign in with Apple or Google (via Clerk) to access the main app.
- Offer in‑app subscriptions (via RevenueCat).
- Run lightweight product analytics (via PostHog, EU host).
- Store onboarding progress locally on your device.

## Data we collect
- **Account data**: Unique ID, email, and name (if provided) via Clerk.
- **Subscription data**: Purchase status/entitlements via RevenueCat (Apple/Google handle payment details).
- **Usage and device data**: Events like “AppLaunched,” OS, app version via PostHog. We do not send raw onboarding answers—only coarse summaries.
- **Scan data**: Barcodes to fetch public product info; photos you choose to analyze (food or label) sent to our AI provider for processing.
- **Onboarding responses**: Stored locally on your device in SecureStore.

We do not knowingly collect sensitive health data or medical records.

## How we use data
- Provide and improve core features (scan, analyze, results).
- Authenticate and secure sessions.
- Verify/manage subscriptions.
- Prevent abuse and troubleshoot.

## Service providers (processors)
- **Clerk**: Authentication and session management.
- **Convex**: Runs server actions; we don’t persist your images there.
- **RevenueCat**: Links subscriptions to your account.
- **OpenAI API**: Processes product text/images you submit; returns analysis.
- **PostHog**: Product analytics (EU endpoint when configured).
- **Open Food Facts**: Public product data by barcode.

Data may be transferred outside your country with appropriate safeguards.

### AI note
Content sent to OpenAI is used to generate results. Per provider policy, limited retention may occur for abuse prevention; it is not used to train models (subject to the provider’s current terms).

## Retention
- Account/subscription data: for the life of your account and as required by law.
- Onboarding answers: on-device until you reset or delete the app.
- Analytics: per provider’s retention.
- AI inputs: not kept by us; providers may keep short‑term logs.

## Your choices and rights
- Camera/photos permission can be denied (some features will not work).
- Account deletion: Settings → Delete Account (removes your Clerk account). Some records may persist where legally required or in provider logs.
- Manage subscription: iOS Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions or in‑app link.
- Contact us for privacy rights (access, correction, deletion): [danielhaukaas@gmail.com].

## Security
We use industry‑standard measures (HTTPS, scoped tokens). No system is 100% secure.

## Children
Not directed to children under 13 (or the local age of consent).

## Third‑party links
Linked sites have their own privacy practices.

## Changes
We may update this Policy; the new “Effective date” will be posted.
